        <br />There is convincing evidence to support private land trust conservation. Most critically endangered species habitat is not within state or federal lands, and it is estimated that 95% of endangered species habitat is found on private land in the United States (Wilcove et al., 1996), which comprises 60% of the land in the U.S. (Stern, 2006). Much of this private land could not be protected without land trust organizations and according to the Defenders of Wildlife “improving private and working land conservation programs is essential” to achieving 30x30 a collective goal adopted by many in the conservation community to conserve and protect 30 percent of the Earth by 2030 to protect biodiversity and ecosystem function (Rosa & Malcom, 2020).<br />
        
        <br />At a broader scale as global temperatures rise due to climate change it will become increasingly important to conserve habitats which contain many microclimates, riparian areas, which are cooler, contiguous, and large landscapes, corridors for movement of species to more suitable areas, and higher elevations where species can move into cooler areas (Anderson et al.,2016). Nature based climate change solutions also have the potential to provide 37 percent of the emission reductions needed by 2030 to keep global temperatures below 2 degrees celsius(Griscom et al.,2017)<br />  
        
        <br />Specifically in Athens County an increasing number of parcels from 2010 to 2019 indicates development which threatens habitat and species movement though the landscape (Kennedy & McFarlane, 2009). Oil and gas development is contributing to this parcelization. As recently as 2013, some Utica Shale gas extraction companies have also started purchasing land in Athens County to potentially conduct hydraulic fracture gas extraction in the future when technology makes exploration economically viable (Smith, 2013).<br />
        
        <br />Increasing access of preserves for low-income and minority groups is vital for the future of conservation and people.Throughout history the conservation movement has primarily consistied of wealthy, white, older individuals (Bonta et al.,2015). This trend continues today which is concerning because the failure to include more diverse groups reduces the reach and impact of conservation organizations and can often silence low-income individuals and communities of color who often experience the brunt of environmental impacts (Bonta et al.,2015).<br />
        
        <br />Historically, minorities and low-income individuals have not frequently visited parks (Taylor et al., 2011). A 2011 study found that 53% of non-Hispanic Whites could name a national park they had visited in the last two years (Taylor et al., 2011). Only 32% of Hispanics and 28% of Black people reported a park they had visited in the last two years. Regardless of race or ethnicity low-income individuals have far less leisure time, access to park information, reliable transportation, and discretionary spending money to travel leading to reduced visitation to parks (McCarville, 2008).Low numbers of these experience among children of color are particularly concerning because outdoor experiences during childhood are critical for developing a lifelong environmental ethic (The Outdoor Foundation,2010). <br />
        
        <br />The national land trust professional association, the Land Trust Alliance, has also recognized the need for more equity and inclusion in the land conservation field. At this year's Land Trust Rally,one of the three central themes is inclusion and equity to create a conservation movement that serves and engages a broader audience.<br />
        
        <br />Athens Conservancy has also recogonized the importance of inclusion and equity and they have set a goal to extend their inclusion and equity accordingly. They understand that being aware of where low-income and minority populations are can help Athens Conservancy weigh access for underserved groups and conservation values in their decision making simultaneously. The result will hopefully afford these groups the opportunity to gain the benefits of outdoor recreation which include improved physical and mental health. Extending access could also provide opportunities for formative experiences for individuals in these groups that will create lifelong supporters of conservation. <br />  </p>

        <li><i class="heading">Describing the purpose of the map.</i>This map is designed to assist Athens Conservancy with the acquisition of more land with conservation value in Athens County, OH. It is also designed to inform the conservancy of travel times for minorities and low-income individuals to the suitable areas identified. </li><br />
    <li><i class="heading">The structure of the map.</i>The first layer will show the areas of high conservation value based on rare, threatened, and endangered species, proximity to protected lands, and stream quality. The remaining two layers will show the drive time from suitable areas for minorities and low-income individuals and their population densities for each drive time (4 min, 8 min, and 12 min). A color code will be used for the concentric polygon rings.  Proportional symbols will be used to represent population densities. </li><br />
    <li><i class="heading">Data sources:</i> Data for the suitability area layer will access rare, threatened, or endangered species, proximity to protected, and stream quality.<br />

        <br />The rare, threatened, or endangered dataset is derived from the Ohio Natural Heritage Database (ONHD) maintained by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. The version obtained for this project was last updated in 2020 and it covers the extent of Athens County. <br />  
        
        <br />Proximity to protected includes two datasets. The Protected Areas Database of the United States, PADUS layer, contains shapefiles of all known protected lands in the U.S. classified by their level of protection. It is maintained by United States Geological Survey and the latest version for Ohio, PADUS2_1_StateOH_Arc10GDB, will be used to limit the extent of the dataset to Ohio. The dataset will be clipped to the Athens County extent. An Athens Conservancy dataset of all their conservation easements and fee simple properties was also be used along with the PADUS layer, because the PADUS layer does not include Athens Conservancy lands.<br />
        
        <br />stream quality will be evaluated using the Aquatic Life Use Monitoring 2018 dataset that is maintained by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the Ohio Wetlands dataset which is maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, last updated in 2021. <br />
        
        <br />Data related to income status and race for Athens County census tracts will be obtained from the 2019 American Community Survey ACS Geodatabase maintained by the United States Census Bureau.</li><br />
    <li><i class="heading">Methodology:</i>    For the suitability layer, each criterion will be evaluated, and an output raster will result. These output rasters will be added together. Areas with high conservation value will have raster cells with the highest scores.<br />

        <br />The conservation of rare, threatened, and endangered species is a component of a larger effort to protect native biodiversity which is positively related to ecosystem function, an indication of a high-quality conservation land (Covich et al., 2004; Balvanera et al. 2006). Land connected to other protected lands offers an opportunity to expand contiguous stretches of protected property which encompasses the larger habitats many species need (TNC, 2016).<br />  
        
        <br />Exceptional warmwater and Coldwater habitats stream designations from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s Aquatic Life Use Monitoring (2014) were used, as recommended by TNC GIS Analyst, August Froelich, to discover and prioritize the riparian lands of high-quality streams (OEPA, 2016). The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency assigns Exceptional Warmwater designations to streams with exceptional or unusual biological communities according to the index of biotic integrity based on "Biological Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Life: Volume II, Users Manual for Biological Field Assessment of Ohio Surface Waters,"(OEPA,2016). Coldwater Habitats are inland trout streams or streams capable of supporting Coldwater native fauna determined by the OEPA Director (OEPA,2016).<br />
        
         <br />The ONHD database has already been clipped to Athens County. It just needs to be imported into ArcGIS Pro. Then the PAD-US layer needs to be clipped to Athens County. The Aquatic Life Use Monitoring 2018 dataset and the Ohio Wetlands dataset must be spatially joined by nearest geodesic, because the Aquatic Life Use Monitoring 2018 dataset is a point dataset that does not extend across the entire stream being monitored. Joining these datasets gives a polygon output that extends the length of streams along with stream quality data.<br />
        
         <br />For the drive time areas related to minority and low-income population, the 2019 American Community Survey ACS tract shapefile must be joined with the separately with both tables for race and income found in the 2019 American Community Survey ACS Geodatabase. Afterwards the race dataset will be selected for only African American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian Pacific, or Asian Indian. Then the income dataset will be selected for low income.<br />
